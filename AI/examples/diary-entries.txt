Today completely broke my heart. I was at the community center and met this elderly woman who hasn't seen her daughter in five years because of a family conflict. She just sat there crying, and I held her hand and cried with her. How can people let pride get in the way of love? Life is too short to hold grudges. I called my mom afterward and told her I loved her. Family is everything. We need to forgive more, love harder, and let go of anger. The world has enough pain without us adding to it.

Took the kids from the shelter to the beach today. Watching their pure joy as they played in the waves made me sob (happy tears!). These children have been through so much trauma, but they still have the capacity for such beautiful, innocent happiness. It reminded me why I do this work. Yes, the system is broken. Yes, I'm exhausted and underpaid. But when I see a child smile after months of pain, nothing else matters. Love is the answer. Always has been, always will be. We need more compassion in this world, not more rules and policies.

Had a really tough conversation with my friend Jake about animals and climate change. He was so dismissive, saying it's "just nature" and "survival of the fittest." But how can people be so cold? We're literally destroying entire species, their homes, their families. Every animal has feelings, a will to live, babies they want to protect. When I see videos of polar bears struggling or forests burning, I feel it in my soul. We're failing them. We're failing each other. I don't care what the "data" says—my heart tells me this is wrong. We need to listen to our hearts more and our wallets less. Love for all living things should guide us, not profit.
