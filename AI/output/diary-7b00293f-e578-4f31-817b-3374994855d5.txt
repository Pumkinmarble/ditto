Today was one of those days where everything feels simultaneously hopeful and hopeless. I woke up to news that global CO2 levels hit another record high - 425 parts per million. For context, pre-industrial levels were 280 ppm. We've fundamentally altered the atmospheric composition of our planet in just 150 years. The scientists interviewed kept using words like "unprecedented" and "irreversible," and I just sat there with my coffee going cold, trying to process what that means for my children's future.


But then I went to the community meeting about our neighborhood sustainability project, and something shifted. There were over 200 people there - parents, students, retirees, business owners - all wanting to take action. We're planning a massive urban tree-planting initiative, converting vacant lots into community gardens, and lobbying the city for protected bike lanes. One woman stood up and talked about how her grandfather was a coal miner, and she's now installing solar panels for a living. The symbolism of that hit me hard. We can change. We are changing. It's just a question of whether we're changing fast enough.


I spent the afternoon reading the latest climate reports - I know, not exactly light reading, but I can't look away. The data is overwhelming. Arctic sea ice declining at 13% per decade. Ocean acidification threatening entire marine ecosystems. Extreme weather events becoming the new normal. Biodiversity loss accelerating. And yet, when I talk to people, so many still think this is debatable, or distant, or someone else's problem. How do we bridge that gap between what science tells us and what people are willing to believe?


My daughter asked me tonight if the polar bears will be extinct when she grows up. She's 9 years old and she's worrying about species extinction. I didn't know what to say. I told her the truth - that it depends on what we do now, in this decade. That her generation will inherit either a crisis or a fighting chance, depending on the choices we make today. She looked at me with these impossibly serious eyes and said, "Then we better make good choices, Mom." Out of the mouths of babes, right?


I'm trying to balance hope and realism. Yes, we've lost time. Yes, some impacts are already locked in. Yes, there are powerful forces invested in the status quo. But we also have the technology, the knowledge, and increasingly, the political will to transition to clean energy. Solar and wind are now cheaper than fossil fuels in most markets. Electric vehicles are going mainstream. Countries are finally setting ambitious emissions targets. It's not enough yet, but it's movement in the right direction.


What keeps me going is remembering that every fraction of a degree matters. The difference between 1.5°C and 2°C of warming isn't academic - it's millions of lives, entire ecosystems, the habitability of regions where billions of people live. We're not fighting for a perfect outcome anymore; we're fighting to limit the damage. And that fight is worth everything we have.


So tomorrow I'll keep pushing. I'll bike to work. I'll advocate for the climate bill. I'll talk to my climate-skeptic uncle again, armed with patience and data. I'll plant trees with my kids and teach them that caring for the Earth isn't optional - it's everything. Because what is the alternative? Accepting catastrophe? Giving up on the only planet we have? No. We fight because we must, because our children are watching, because the science is clear, and because hope is not naive - it's necessary. The planet has given us everything. Now it's asking us to give something back. And I will, every single day, for as long as it takes.

I am feeling a little sick today. I could not go in to office.
