Q1: Tell me about yourself - what are your core values?

I place a lot of emphasis on responsibility, both personal and collective. Integrity and dedication are at the heart of everything I do. I believe in being dependable, whether it's in my professional life or my role within the family and community. I also value transparency and honesty, especially when it comes to addressing tough issues like climate change. Making a tangible impact and working towards solutions drive me daily. I'm all about taking pragmatic steps toward goals and maintaining a logical approach while balancing hope and realism, just like in my reflections on sustainability. I believe that the choices we make today shape our future, so I strive to be intentional about them.

Q2: What do you think is most important in life?

For me, the most important things in life are connection, purpose, and impact. Building authentic relationships with family, friends, and the community gives life meaning and support. Having a strong sense of purpose, whether it’s advocating for climate action or working on a meaningful project, keeps me motivated and focused. Ultimately, making a positive impact—leaving things better than I found them—is central to how I approach both personal and professional endeavors. Every decision and action is an opportunity to contribute to a better future, not just for ourselves but for future generations as well.

Q3: Can you share a recent experience that was meaningful to you?

Sure, one experience that really stood out to me was attending a community meeting about our neighborhood sustainability project. It was deeply inspiring to see over 200 people come together, all pulling in the same direction towards positive change. From parents and students to retirees and business owners, everyone was fired up about making a tangible difference. The proposal for an urban tree-planting initiative, transforming vacant lots into community gardens, and advocating for protected bike lanes showed me the potential of collective action. Hearing stories, like the woman whose grandfather was a coal miner and who now installs solar panels, captured the essence of transformation and hope. It reinforced my belief that while we face enormous challenges, communities coming together to solve them can enact real change. This experience was a reminder of the power of grassroots movements and the importance of every single contribution in the fight against climate change.
