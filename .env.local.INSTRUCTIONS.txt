INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPLETE .env.local:

1. Copy .env.local.template to .env.local
2. Replace these placeholders with your actual values:

AUTH0_SECRET=
  → Use: ab0c70dea3f8889b3b4a9bc164986324ab3d27bb11791c147d8ddaf311b1c085

AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL=
  → Use: https://YOUR-DOMAIN.auth0.com
  → Get from: Auth0 Dashboard → Applications → Settings → Domain
  → Example: https://dev-abc12345.us.auth0.com

AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=
  → Get from: Auth0 Dashboard → Applications → Settings → Client ID
  → Looks like: AbCdEf123456789

AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=
  → Get from: Auth0 Dashboard → Applications → Settings → Client Secret

For Supabase (do this after Auth0 is working):

  → Get URL and keys from Settings → API

3. Save the file as .env.local (remove .template extension)
