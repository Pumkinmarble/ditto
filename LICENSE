                            Preamble

 The GNU Affero General Public License is a free software license that ensures end users have the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software. This license is designed specifically for software that is typically run on a server, ensuring that users who interact with the software over a network are granted the same freedoms.

 The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU Affero General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share the software and that you receive the source code when you interact with it. This license encourages developers to contribute back to the community.

 The GNU AGPL v3.0 guarantees end users the freedom to:

 - Run the program as you wish, for any purpose
 - Study how the program works, and change it to make it do what you wish
 - Redistribute copies of the original program so you can help others
 - Distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. You can ask the original author for help.

 There are some requirements for sharing modified versions. You must share your modifications under the same license, ensuring that everyone else also has the freedom to use and modify the software.

 This license is a strong copyleft license, meaning that any work derived from or based on AGPL v3.0 licensed software must also be distributed under the same license, and the source code must be made available to users interacting with the software over a network.
